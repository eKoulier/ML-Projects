# ML-Projects

Here I have my projects for the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) offered by [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/). You may find my certificate for this Nanodegree [here](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/FUNWY223).

## Transfer Learning for Dog Breed Classification

This project is related to Transfer Learning. 
I had to develop an algorithm that given a picture of a dog, it returns its breed. If there
is a human in a picture the algorithm understands it, and then it tries to find the dog breed
that he mostly resembles with. 

## Classifying the White Wine Quality Dataset

This is the Captstone one. It was a challenging classification task: Given a few 
physiochemical characteristics of a white wine, I developed an algorithm that predicts its 
quality.

## Finding Donors for CharityML

In this project I had to  accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 thus he/she is willing to donate
to CharityML. I employed several supervised algorithms and I fine tuned the one that had the best performance. Several details
were taken care of: The data was highly skewed, thus selecting the right metric took place. Apart from that, the other challenge
was the fact that the data was mixed and included nominal, categorical and continous variables.
