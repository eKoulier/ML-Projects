# ML-Projects
Here I have my projects for the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) offered by [https://eu.udacity.com/].


The first project is related to Transfer Learning. 
I had to develop an algorithm that given a picture of a dog, it returns its breed. If there
is a human in a picture the algorithm understands it, and then it tries to find the dog breed
that he mostly resembles with. 

The Second Project is the Captstone one. It was a challenging classification task: Given a few 
physiochemical characteristics of a white wine, I developed an algorithm that predicts its 
quality.
